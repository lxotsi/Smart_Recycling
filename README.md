# Smart Recycling: Automated Object Detection and Classification for Informed Policy and Enhanced Recycling (AODCIPER)

## Project Overview

The **AODCIPER** project addresses the global challenge of inefficient waste management and rising contamination rates in recycled materials. By integrating advanced machine learning (ML) and high-speed cameras with image recognition technology, this system aims to significantly improve the accuracy of waste sorting, surpassing manual methods by 80-90%. The result is enhanced efficiency in waste management and higher-quality recycled materials, contributing to environmental sustainability.

## Features

- **AI Integration**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms for accurate material detection and classification.
- **Data Recording & Reporting**: Continuously monitors sorting processes and generates detailed reports.
- **Conveyor Belt System**: Robust infrastructure for effective material movement.
- **Intelligent Camera Network**: Captures high-resolution images for analysis.
- **Multi-Material Sorting**: Capable of sorting plastic, paper, metal, glass, and cardboard.
